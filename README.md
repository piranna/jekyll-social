# jekyll-social
Publish your Jekyll posts on several social networks and include the URL in the
frontmatter

Search for the new posts that has not been already published, publish them, and
update their frontmatters to add the reference to the publication. Currently
only support to create tweets, but code is easily extensible to add other social
networks.
